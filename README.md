<h1>Website profile widged</h1>

I wanted to try to create same thing as using linkedin, facebook ect. when you put any url you see meta tags (description and logo) and title in nice box which links to added url.

Lets give an explanation and examples


more source and demo is comming!

Mostly I strugle to get the meta tags info from client scripts (js, jQuery) of <i>..cross domain JS Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt; </i> I find amazing <a href="http://call.jsonlib.com/examples.html">JS lib </a> to make my life so easy!
Moreover when i get the meta tags I parse them with simple <a href="http://rubular.com/">regular expression </a> and I found amazing <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" >JS simulator for testing</a>. But regular expression is not good way cause meta tags property name.. can change possition in tag - thats the problem! the other thing would be nice to find the image via website tag! Lets keep working!
