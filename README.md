I wanted to try to create same thing as using linked.in and facebook ect. to show url you gave meta tags(description and logo) nice box which links to this url.

Lets give an explanation and examples

more source and demo is comming!

Mostly I strugle to get the meta tags info from client scripts (js, jQuery) of <i>..cross domain JS Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt; </i> I find amazing <a href="http://call.jsonlib.com/examples.html">JS lib </a> to make my life so easy!
Moreover when i get the meta tags I parse them with simple <a href="http://rubular.com/">regular expression </a> and I found amazing <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" >JS simulator for testing</a>.
